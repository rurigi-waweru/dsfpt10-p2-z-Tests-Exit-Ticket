# Question 1
Cristian is wondering whether the turtles of a certain species living near the nuclear plant have longer necks than the turtles of that same species that live elsewhere. What should his null hypothesis be?

> [i] (Correct) The turtles living near the nuclear plant do not have longer necks than the turtles living elsewhere.

> [ii] The turtles living near the nuclear plant have necks no shorter than the turtles living elsewhere.

> [iii] The nuclear plant has no causal effect on the lengths of turtle necks.

> [iv] The turtles living near the nuclear plant have longer necks than the turtles living elsewhere.

> [v] The difference between average turtle neck lengths of the two turtle populations is less than one pooled standard deviation.
`Explanation:`
The null hypothesis (H₀) typically represents a statement of no effect or no difference. In this case, Cristian is investigating whether turtles near the nuclear plant have longer necks than those elsewhere.

> The null hypothesis assumes no difference or that any observed difference is due to chance.

> This means we assume the neck lengths are not longer near the nuclear plant unless evidence suggests otherwise.

Thus, the `correct` null hypothesis is:
##### "The turtles living near the nuclear plant do not have longer necks than the turtles living elsewhere."
# Question 2
What would an alpha value of 0.1 mean for the above experiment?

> [i] That 10% of the time the turtles near the plant would be found to have longer necks.

> [ii] That Cristian will tolerate a 1% chance of concluding that the turtles near the plant have longer necks when in fact they do not.

> [iii] (correct) That Cristian will tolerate a 10% chance of concluding that the turtles near the plant have longer necks when in fact they do not.

> [iv] That 10% of all turtles would be misclassified.

> [v] That 1% of all turtles would be misclassified.
## Understanding Alpha (α) in Hypothesis Testing

> The alpha value (α) represents the significance level, which is the probability of committing a Type I error.

> A Type I error occurs when we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually true.

> In this experiment, the null hypothesis is:
"The turtles living near the nuclear plant do not have longer necks than the turtles living elsewhere."

> If α = 0.1, it means Cristian is willing to accept a 10% risk of falsely rejecting this null hypothesis, concluding that the turtles near the plant have longer necks when, in reality, they do not.

## Verifying the Answer Choices

>[i] "That 10% of the time the turtles near the plant would be found to have longer necks."
❌ Incorrect. The alpha value does not indicate how often turtles actually have longer necks—it only defines the probability of a false conclusion.

>[ii] "That Cristian will tolerate a 1% chance of concluding that the turtles near the plant have longer necks when in fact they do not."
❌ Incorrect. This describes an alpha of 0.01 (1%), not 0.1 (10%).

>[iii]"That Cristian will tolerate a 10% chance of concluding that the turtles near the plant have longer necks when in fact they do not."
✅ Correct. This properly defines the significance level (α = 0.1), meaning there is a 10% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis.

>[iv]"That 10% of all turtles would be misclassified."
❌ Incorrect. The significance level has nothing to do with individual turtle misclassification—it is about hypothesis testing errors.

>[v] "That 1% of all turtles would be misclassified."
❌ Incorrect. Same reason as above.

## `Final Conclusion`
In a proper analysis, the correct interpretation of α = 0.1 is:
✅ "That Cristian will tolerate a 10% chance of concluding that the turtles near the plant have longer necks when in fact they do not."
# Question 3
What does a p-value represent?

>[i] The chance that your test results are mistaken.

>[ii] The chance of seeing a difference at least as extreme as your sample's difference assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

>[iii] The change of seeing a difference no more extreme than your sample's difference.

>[iv] The chance of seeing a difference between samples assuming that the alternative hypothesis is true.

>[v] The chance of getting a false positive.
## The `correct answer` is:

✅ "[ii] The chance of seeing a difference at least as extreme as your sample's difference assuming that the null hypothesis is true."

## `Explanation:`
The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed result, assuming the null hypothesis (H₀) is true.

## Evaluating Each Answer Choice:
> "[i] The chance that your test results are mistaken."
❌ Incorrect. This is too vague. The p-value does not directly measure the probability that the test is wrong—it quantifies how likely the observed data is under H₀.

> "[ii] The chance of seeing a difference at least as extreme as your sample's difference assuming that the null hypothesis is true."
✅ Correct. This is the textbook definition of a p-value. It measures how extreme the observed data is under the assumption that H₀ is true.

> "[iii] The chance of seeing a difference no more extreme than your sample's difference."
❌ Incorrect. The p-value considers results as extreme or more extreme, not just "no more extreme."

> "[iv] The chance of seeing a difference between samples assuming that the alternative hypothesis is true."
❌ Incorrect. The p-value is calculated assuming the null hypothesis is true, not the alternative hypothesis.

> "[v] The chance of getting a false positive."
❌ Incorrect. A false positive (Type I error) is related to the alpha level (α), not the p-value directly.

## `Final Answer:`
✅ "[ii] The chance of seeing a difference at least as extreme as your sample's difference assuming that the null hypothesis is true."
